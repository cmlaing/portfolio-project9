            Have you ever wanted to organize your employees in a simple, 
            easy to read directory? Each employee has their own clickable card 
            that opens a new popup window with all their contact information! 
            <br>
            Keeping everyone's information together has never been easier!

            This fun, interactive word guessing game features JavaScript at its core. 
            The user clicks the onscreen keyboard to choose a letter. If the letter is in 
            the unknown phrase, it will light up and the chosen key becomes disabled. 
            If the letter is not in the phrase, the user loses a heart icon. 
            The game ends with a win if the phrase is guessed before running out of heart icons, 
            or it ends with a loss if the phrase was not correctly guessed before the user 
            ran out of heart icons. 
            What do you win as a prize? Some might say it is of the cute and cuddly variety... 
            Play to find out more.

                Do you want to display some important graphs and/or charts in a stylized, 
                easy to read manner? This mobile-first responsive website does just that. 
                Each line chart, bar chart, and donut chart uses several data sets to display 
                the information in a clear and concise way. The line chart even dynamically 
                changes the displayed information based on what setting is chosen (Daily, Hourly, etc). 
                Furthermore, the use of local storage saves settings on the screen that the user inputs, 
                using toggle switches and a drop down timezone menu. Some fun JavaScript is also at play 
                with a notification menu and alert banner.

                Do you have a subscription service that requires the use 
                of forms? Or how about collecting user input to create a profile 
                or custom experience? A form can do just that! This organized, 
                easy to read form has areas for user input such as name, email, 
                and address, as well as options to check for preferred 
                newsletter input or content.

            Are you a fan of Sass? This well organized project demonstrates the power of Sass! 
            As a companion to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Sass helps implement these styles in 
            a modular format. Although this project is on the smaller side, a larger project with 
            multiple team members would benefit from such a modular approach like Sass. 
            Each section has been broken down into three subcategories: base, components, and utilities. 
            The Base section includes things like typography and normalizing style sheets for a level 
            playing field. The Utilities includes variables and mixins - repeatable code to "mix into" 
            your regular style sheets. Finally, the Components section includes bits and pieces that 
            make up your website like buttons, form, the overall grid, navigation, and media 
            queries. It may sound like a bit to take in, but it is actually quite straight-forward 
            and a very useful tool to be familiar with.

    <img src="img/game-controller.svg" class="icon center-icon">
    <p>
        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Crystal Laing 
        and I reside on Vancouver Island, B.C. 
    </p>
    <p> I am interested in making beautiful and functional websites.
        Learning is one of my passions and I love how the tech field offers so many 
        avenues for continued learning. Whether it is designing websites or filtering through 
        back-end server code, there is always something new to explore. Aside from web design 
        and development, I am also intrigued by cyber security. 
    </p>
    <p>Aside from the web, I have a strong interest in video games, cooking, and gardening.
        Some of my favorite games include the Final Fantasy series, Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4, 
        Skyrim, and No Man's Sky, to name a few. I try to cook something new each week, but I do 
        have my favorites such as Thai green chicken curries, Indian curries, German cuisine, 
        and Asian delights like teriyaki stirfries or sesame chicken. To keep up with my food 
        hobby, I also have a garden of various vegetables along with blueberries, strawberries, 
        and Santa Rosa plums. A perfect day to me includes some productivity, gathering bounty 
        from the garden, cooking a wonderful meal, and then gaming out with my boyfriend (with snacks, 
        of course).
